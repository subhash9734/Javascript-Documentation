            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
              (WWW).

            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

              Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
              one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <h2>Hello world:-</h2>
        <article>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!

      <section id="Variables">
        <h2>Variables:-</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
